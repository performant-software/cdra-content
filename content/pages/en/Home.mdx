      The Archive Map of Cabildo de Regla is a dynamic visual guide to the
      sacred spaces, historical artifacts, oral histories, and ritual practices
      that define this Afro-Cuban spiritual community. Centered in Regla, Cuba,
      this map traces the rich legacy of the cabildo, a Black mutual aid and
      religious society rooted in Yoruba, Bantu, and Arará traditions. The map
      links archival materials—including photographs, documents, ceremonial
      objects, and multimedia recordings—to key sites and events, providing an
      interactive journey through the living heritage of African diasporic
      resistance, spirituality, and cultural preservation. It serves as both a
      research tool and an educational resource for understanding the cabildo’s
      role in sustaining Afro-Cuban identity across generations.
